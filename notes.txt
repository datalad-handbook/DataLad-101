One can create a new dataset with 'datalad create [--description] PATH'.
The dataset is created empty

The command "datalad save [-m] PATH" saves the file
(modifications) to history. Note to self:
Always use informative, concise commit messages.

The command 'datalad clone URL/PATH [PATH]'
installs a dataset from e.g., a URL or a path.
If you install a dataset into an existing
dataset (as a subdataset), remember to specify the
root of the superdataset with the '-d' option.

There are two useful functions to display changes between two
states of a dataset: "datalad diff -f/--from COMMIT -t/--to COMMIT"
and "git diff COMMIT COMMIT", where COMMIT is a shasum of a commit
in the history.
