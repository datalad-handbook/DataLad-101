One can create a new dataset with 'datalad create [--description] PATH'.
The dataset is created empty

The command "datalad save [-m] PATH" saves the file (modifications) to
history.
Note to self: Always use informative, concise commit messages.

The command 'datalad clone URL/PATH [PATH]' installs a dataset from
e.g., a URL or a path. If you install a dataset into an existing
dataset (as a subdataset), remember to specify the root of the
superdataset with the '-d' option.
